__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.__

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


```

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}
#| label: Q1 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here
subset = df.filter(['before1980', 'yrbuilt', 'netprice', 'numbdrm', 'numbaths', 'nocars'])

colors = ['blue', 'red']


chart = px.scatter(subset,
    x="nocars", 
    y="netprice",
    color="before1980",
    color_discrete_sequence=colors,
    size="netprice"
)
chart.show()
```


<!-- ```{python}
#| label: Q1 table
#| code-summary: table example
#| tbl-cap: "Not much of a table"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
mydat = df.head(1000)\
    .groupby('year')\
    .sum()\
    .reset_index()\
    .tail(10)\
    .filter(["year", "AK","AR"])

display(mydat)

``` -->


## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.__

_type your results and analysis here_

<!-- ```{python}
#| label: Q2
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here


``` -->

_include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

<!-- ```{python}
#| label: Q2 chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here
chart = px.bar(df.head(200),
    x="name", 
    y="AK"
)

## QUESTION|TASK 3

__Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.__
